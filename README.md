# FreakingAwesome.ValidationResult

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions/blob/master/LICENSE)

This is a forked and slimmed down version of the `Result` and `Result<Ok>` types from [Functional Extensions for
C#](https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions) which swap in a list of Validation Errors for the single
string error message found in the original, where each Validation Error consists of an optional field name and error
message, reminiscent of ASP.Net MVC ModelState error reporting paradigm.

## Motivation

The `Result` structs and extensions are a great foundation, but the single string `Error` inside `Result` and
`Result<Ok>` were too limiting, while `Result<Ok, Err>` extensions were incomplete.

Adding all the extra functionality to `Result<Ok, Err>` just proved too cumbersome and was just to unwieldy in the end,
so I instead chose to swap out the internals of `Result` `Result<Ok>` with an `Error` value I have found useful in the
past, renaming to `ValidationResult` with the intention of being able to still make use of the more generalized `Result`
and `Result<Ok>` classes by referencing
[`CSharpFunctionalExtensions`](https://github.com/vkhorikov/CSharpFunctionalExtensions) via nuget.

## Immutable ValidationErrors

The `ValidationError` and `ValidationResult` classes are immutable, but the classes can be joined and chained together
in a few different ways.

## TODO

 - [ ] More tests
 - [ ] Documentation and examples
 - [ ] Publish on nuget.org
